<h3>👨‍💻 About Me</h3>

- 🎓 I'm a "future" full-stack developer who's currently learning the ropes.
- 🤖 I'm into IoT, and I've built a few Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects that... kind of work.
- 🎨 I'm a big fan of making things look good with CSS, and sometimes, I even use Bootstrap.😂 My favorite UI kit is Material UI.
- 💬 Feel free to hit me up if you want to chat about anything tech-related.

<h3>🚀 My Skills</h3>


- 🌐 I'm proficient in the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. I enjoy building web apps using this technology stack.
- 💻 I know HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. But let's be real, sometimes I'm just too lazy to use them. 😅 Instead, I've been diving headfirst into the MERN stack using TypeScript and JavaScript. 
- 📱 I can whip up a decent React Native or Swift app, but it'll probably have a few bugs that I'll get around to fixing eventually.
- 🦾 I can create my own APIs with Express and Node, and I've dabbled in Deno, but only because it was trending on Twitter. I can also use PHP to create APIs, but I don't really like PHP. 
- 📊 I've used MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to store data,  but I prefer MongoDB because it's easier to use.
- 🤖 I've used Raspberry Pi and Arduino to build some cool projects, but mostly, I just like to play around with LEDs.
- 🛏️ I use c and c++ to build some cool stuff. 
- 🐍 do you know python, everybody knows python !, I use it on Raspberry Pi for IoT projects also I use it for Django, create bots, and more.

- 🤷‍♂️ Other skills include using Debian to set up web servers, Kali for security testing, and Selenium for web scraping.
